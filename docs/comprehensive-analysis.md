GitHub Copilot: Here are some suggestions for improving the project based on the provided README.md and workspace structure:

1. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Add more detailed examples for each LLM backend (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) in the README.md to help users understand how to configure and use them.
   - Include a troubleshooting section for common issues with each specific LLM backend.
   - Provide a link to the api directory for users to explore the API documentation directly.

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Consider separating the demo files (`demo_openai.py`, demo_gemini.py, etc.) into a dedicated `examples/` directory for better organization.
   - Move the config_template.json and config.json files into a `config/` directory to keep the root directory cleaner.

3. **Testing**:
   - Ensure that the tests directory has comprehensive test coverage for all major components, especially the LLM backends and MCP integration.
   - Add a README.md in the tests directory to explain the testing strategy and how to run the tests.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Provide a sample .env file in the repository (e.g., `.env.example`) to help users set up their environment variables quickly.

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure that the ruff.toml configuration is optimized for the project's coding style and standards.
   - Use tools like `black` or `isort` for consistent code formatting.

6. **Dependency Management**:
   - Verify that the requirements.txt and requirements-test.txt files are up-to-date and include all necessary dependencies.
   - Consider using a tool like `pip-tools` to manage dependencies more effectively.

7. **Logging**:
   - Expand the logging documentation to include examples of how to customize log levels and formats.

8. **Interactive Diagrams**:
   - The mermaid diagram in the README.md is excellent. Consider linking it to an interactive version or providing a rendered image for users unfamiliar with mermaid syntax.

9. **Contributing Guidelines**:
   - Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to provide detailed instructions for contributors, including coding standards, branch naming conventions, and pull request guidelines.

10. **CI/CD**:
    - Ensure that the GitHub Actions workflow for tests is robust and includes checks for code quality, formatting, and security vulnerabilities.

11. **Badges**:
    - Add a badge for the latest release version and download statistics from PyPI to the README.md.

12. **Examples**:
    - Include more complex examples in the README.md that demonstrate the integration of multiple MCP servers and tools.

Let me know if you'd like to focus on any specific area or implement these suggestions!

hongyan99: Can you review the complete codebase and suggest for improvement?

GitHub Copilot: Based on the comprehensive review of your codebase, here are some suggestions for improvement:

### General Codebase Suggestions
1. **Code Organization**:
   - Consider moving demo scripts (`demo_openai.py`, demo_gemini.py, etc.) into a dedicated `examples/` directory for better organization.
   - Group configuration files (`config_template.json`, config.json, .env) into a `config/` directory.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Expand the README.md with more detailed examples for each LLM backend (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic).
   - Add a troubleshooting section for common issues, such as API key misconfigurations or server connection problems.
   - Include rendered diagrams (e.g., from Mermaid) in the documentation for users unfamiliar with the syntax.

3. **Testing**:
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all major components, especially the LLM backends and MCP integration.
   - Add integration tests for multi-server scenarios and complex tool interactions.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages to provide more actionable insights, especially in tool execution and server connection failures.
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for server connections.

5. **Logging**:
   - Enhance the logging system to include more granular log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
   - Add log rotation and sanitization for sensitive data.

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Use tools like `black` for consistent code formatting and `isort` for import sorting.
   - Ensure the ruff.toml configuration aligns with the project's coding standards.

7. **Dependency Management**:
   - Verify that requirements.txt and requirements-test.txt are up-to-date and include all necessary dependencies.
   - Consider using `pip-tools` or `poetry` for better dependency management.

8. **Environment Variables**:
   - Provide a `.env.example` file to help users set up their environment variables quickly.

9. **CI/CD**:
   - Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow includes checks for code quality, formatting, and security vulnerabilities.
   - Add badges for test coverage and code quality to the README.md.

10. **Examples**:
    - Include more complex examples in the documentation, such as multi-server usage and advanced tool integration.

### Specific Suggestions for Key Components
1. **LLM Backends**:
   - Ensure that the `LLMBackend` interface is well-documented with examples for custom implementations.
   - Add more robust error handling for API rate limits and timeouts.

2. **MCPToolProvider**:
   - Improve lifecycle management by adding hooks for custom initialization and cleanup logic.
   - Document the tool registration and execution process in detail.

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Provide a guide for creating custom tools, including best practices for schema validation and error handling.

4. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Add more detailed health monitoring metrics, such as response times and error rates.
   - Include a recovery mechanism for persistent failures.

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources, especially in cases of unexpected errors or interruptions.
